        <p>The project which became Firefox started as an experimental branch of the <a
                href="https://www-archive.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/">Mozilla Suite</a> called m/b (or
            mozilla/browser). After it had been sufficiently developed, binaries for public testing appeared in
            September 2002 under the name Phoenix.

            Firefox 23 was released on August 6, 2013. It includes an updated Firefox logo, mixed content blocking
            enabled by default to defend against man-in-the-middle attacks, implementation of the range form control
            attribute in HTML5, dropping support for the blink HTML element as well as text-decoration:blink CSS
            element, the restriction to have to “switch to a different search provider across the entire browser,” and a
            global browser console, a new network monitor among other things.
